🛠️ 𝐍𝐋𝐏 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐤𝐢𝐭 - 𝐀𝐥𝐥-𝐢𝐧-𝐎𝐧𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐩𝐩

This is a beginner-friendly NLP Toolkit Web App, designed to make text-related tasks simple and accessible — no complicated setups, no switching between tools!

I built this as part of my Generative AI & Chatbot Development course at SMIT, keeping in mind how much time we spend on data cleaning and text processing, especially during AI and chatbot projects.

✨ 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀

✅ Text Processing (Tokenization, POS Tags, NER, Lemmatization)
✅ Sentiment Analysis (Polarity, Subjectivity, WordCloud)
✅ News Article Classification (Using ML pipeline)
✅ Text Cleaning (Lowercase, Punctuation, Numbers, Stopwords Removal)
✅ Text Summarization (LexRank, Luhn, LSA methods)
✅ Text Translation (Multiple languages)
✅ Voice Translation (Speech-to-text + Translation + Text-to-speech)

💡 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐀𝐩𝐩?

When working on chatbot or AI projects, I noticed:

Text cleaning & preprocessing wastes a lot of time

Beginners struggle with multiple tools & complex code

Translation is often needed but hard to integrate

So, I thought — Why not build one simple app that brings these features together?

🔧 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸

Streamlit — Fast UI for web apps

spaCy & NLTK — NLP processing

TextBlob — Sentiment Analysis

scikit-learn — News classification

Sumy — Text summarization

GoogleTranslator & gTTS — Translation & speech

SpeechRecognition & pydub — Voice input handling
